# What is this?

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault I created to take some notes about things I learn while joining the competitive programming world. I've chosen to write everything in English because there's very little learning material for CP in my native language (portuguese) and I want this note taking proccess to be as quick as possible so I'm not interested in understanding everything and translating to write down here. Another reason is that I'm very interested in sharing everything I learned and my insights about some problems for everyone to see, and knowing that the target audience for something such as this would be people that are already familiarized with programming and most people coming from this area have been dealing with english for some time now, I think this language is the right choice.

As I'm writing this (April 26th 2023) I'm just a beginner without much things to offer but I'm willing to put a lot of effort into this resulting in a nice knowledge database for people to explore.

Updates might come very frequently, probably every 3~4 days.
